# The Mathematics Behind Neural Networks

## Forward Propagation

A simple neural network layer:

$$
z = Wx + b
$$

Where $W$ is the weight matrix and $b$ is the bias vector.

## Activation Functions

Sigmoid function:

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

ReLU function:

$$
\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
$$
