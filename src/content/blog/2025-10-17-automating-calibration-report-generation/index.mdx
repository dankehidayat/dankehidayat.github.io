## A Comparative Analysis of DHT11 and HTC-1 Sensors Using Fuzzy Logic and LaTeX

When I first started comparing the accuracy of my **DHT11 sensor**, I didn’t expect the project to evolve into a full data analysis pipeline. Initially, my goal was simple — determine how accurate the DHT11 really was compared to a reference instrument, the **HTC-1**. But as I went deeper, I realized I could automate the entire workflow: from analyzing raw data to generating a complete **LaTeX-formatted PDF report**, directly in **Google Colab**.

This post walks through how I designed that system — how I collected and analyzed the calibration data, applied fuzzy logic for comfort assessment, and produced a full scientific report automatically.

## Introduction

Monitoring environmental conditions like temperature and humidity is critical for maintaining comfort and energy efficiency, especially in tropical office environments.
Low-cost IoT sensors such as the DHT11 are convenient but not always reliable. My intention was to evaluate how well the DHT11 performs compared to a reference-grade device like the HTC-1 and to see if calibration could meaningfully improve its readings.

To make the process reproducible and less error-prone, I conducted the entire analysis in **Google Colab**, which offered a complete Python environment, built-in plotting, and direct Google Drive integration for storing results.

## Data Collection

The experiment took place in a **naturally ventilated office** located in Indonesia. I placed both sensors — DHT11 and HTC-1 — side by side under identical conditions to minimize spatial variation.
I collected two datasets: one **before calibration** and one **after calibration**, representing the performance difference.

The measurements covered several hours of normal office operation, capturing both day and evening temperature fluctuations. Each dataset contained paired readings of temperature and humidity.

## Statistical Analysis in Colab

I started the analysis by importing necessary Python libraries and loading the datasets into Colab:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
```

### Error Metrics

The first evaluation used **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** to measure how far DHT11 readings deviated from the HTC-1 values.
These two metrics provide a clear picture of how close the low-cost sensor’s readings are to the reference tool.

The equations I used were:

$$
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum |X_i - Y_i|, \quad RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (X_i - Y_i)^2}
$$

The MAE shows the average absolute error, while RMSE penalizes larger deviations more strongly.

### Regression and Agreement

Next, I applied a **linear regression model** to characterize how DHT11 readings align with HTC-1 readings:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
$$

This helped determine how calibration improved the sensor’s linear relationship. I also used **Bland–Altman analysis** to study the bias and consistency between the sensors.
After calibration, the bias was notably smaller, and the readings were more uniform, confirming the improvement.

## Calibration Outcome

After running the calibration procedure, the results were clear:
the DHT11 sensor’s measurement accuracy improved dramatically for both temperature and humidity.
While the pre-calibration readings showed noticeable offsets, the post-calibration values closely matched the reference measurements.
This validated that even inexpensive sensors could achieve acceptable accuracy when proper calibration and statistical correction are applied.

## Applying Fuzzy Mamdani Logic for Comfort Evaluation

To extend the analysis beyond numbers, I implemented a **Fuzzy Mamdani inference system** to interpret the environmental data in terms of **thermal comfort**.

The system categorized the environment as _Cold_, _Comfortable_, or _Hot_, based on fuzzy membership functions designed specifically for tropical conditions:

```python
cold = fuzz.trapmf(temp, [20, 20, 24, 25.5])
comfortable = fuzz.trimf(temp, [25, 27.5, 30])
hot = fuzz.trapmf(temp, [29, 31, 34, 34])
```

The fuzzy logic approach allowed me to quantify comfort perception on a continuous scale from 0 to 10.
The analysis revealed that most readings fell within the _Comfortable_ range, suggesting that the room environment maintained stable and favorable conditions throughout most of the observation period.

This was a useful complement to the calibration analysis, providing a more intuitive interpretation of what the sensor readings meant in human terms.

## Automating LaTeX Report Generation

After verifying the results, I wanted to present them in a professional and reproducible format.
Instead of manually creating figures, equations, and descriptions in a separate document, I used Python’s **pylatex** library to automatically generate the full report.

Here’s an example snippet of how I structured the automation:

```python
from pylatex import Document, Section, NoEscape

doc = Document("Scientific_Thermal_Comfort_Report")

with doc.create(Section("Results and Discussion")):
    doc.append("This section presents the calibration outcomes and fuzzy logic analysis performed in Colab.")

doc.generate_pdf(clean_tex=False)
```

This basic example was expanded to include all key sections: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion.
The LaTeX code was dynamically constructed based on actual Colab results — including the computed metrics, equations, and descriptive text.

To ensure the file was easily shareable, I saved it directly to Google Drive:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
doc.generate_pdf('/content/drive/MyDrive/Scientific_Thermal_Comfort_Report', clean_tex=False)
```

This made the report instantly accessible through a shareable Drive link once the notebook finished running.

## Reflections

What began as a small calibration test turned into a complete research workflow combining **data analysis**, **fuzzy logic modeling**, and **automated documentation**.
Running everything inside Google Colab helped me avoid setup issues while maintaining full reproducibility.

The integration of LaTeX generation was the most satisfying part — it transformed Colab from a simple coding notebook into a publishing tool. Every rerun could produce a new report, fully formatted and containing updated values.

This project reminded me how automation can enhance both accuracy and presentation in small-scale research.
It also showed that with the right tools, even low-cost sensors like the DHT11 can deliver meaningful and interpretable insights when supported by data-driven calibration.
