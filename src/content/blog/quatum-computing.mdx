# Understanding Quantum Computing with Linear Algebra

Quantum computing represents one of the most exciting frontiers in modern technology.

## The Mathematics of Qubits

### What is a Qubit?

A qubit exists in a superposition of states:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
$$

Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfy:

$$
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

### Quantum Gates

The Pauli-X gate:

$$
X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$
