## About me

I'm Danke Hidayat, a Computer Engineering student at IPB University in Depok, Indonesia. I've always been drawn to how things work—especially how hardware and software come together to create systems that actually help people. Whether it's a sensor network that saves energy or a smarter way to sort waste, I enjoy solving problems that have real impact.

That quote from Maya Tendō—"Even if I have to fight you, I won't stop moving forward"—resonates with how I approach engineering challenges. Some problems are stubborn, but I believe persistence and good thinking usually find a way through.

## What I do

My work sits right at the intersection of hardware and software:

- **IoT and Embedded Systems** – Building with ESP32, Arduino, and similar platforms to create devices that sense, process, and communicate data.
- **Networking and Security** – I'm CCNA/CCNP certified and enjoy designing networks that are both reliable and secure.
- **Full-Stack Development** – Creating complete applications, from Laravel backends to responsive frontends.
- **Data and Cloud** – Working with sensor data flows, cloud databases, and visualization dashboards.
- **Electronics Design** – Designing circuits and PCBs, turning ideas into physical prototypes.

## Work experience

My professional background has given me a mix of technical and analytical perspectives:

- **Data Analyst and Software Tester** at PT. Global Kreatif Inovasi – Here I learned how important clean data and thoughtful user experience really are. Testing applications taught me to see software from the user's perspective.
- **Assistant IT Officer** at Wyndham Hotel – This was my introduction to maintaining critical systems under real-world pressure. Everything from network troubleshooting to configuring POS systems.
- **IoT projects** – Leading the development of an energy monitoring system using fuzzy logic and building an automated trash sorting bin have been particularly rewarding. Both required thinking about hardware constraints, user needs, and practical deployment.

## Academic work

At IPB University (current GPA: 3.57/4.00), I've been involved in several research projects that bridge theory and practice:

- Applying fuzzy logic to energy monitoring and cost prediction
- Co-authoring papers on inventory systems, livestock platforms, and environmental monitoring
- Using User-Centered Design methods to build more intuitive applications
- Serving as course coordinator, which helped me learn how to explain technical concepts clearly

## How I work

I've found that successful engineering projects usually share a few common approaches:

- **Start with the problem** – Understanding what needs solving before jumping to solutions
- **Pay attention to details** – Small calibration adjustments or code optimizations often make big differences
- **Keep learning** – Technology changes fast, and staying curious is essential
- **Work well with others** – Some of my best results have come from collaborating with designers, other engineers, and end-users

## Other interests

When I'm not working on technical projects, I might be:

- Learning Japanese (both language and cultural context)
- Participating in robotics clubs and hardware workshops
- Writing about technical topics on my blog
- Working through online certifications to expand my skills
- Communicating in English (TOEIC: 755) with international colleagues

## Getting in touch

I'm currently looking for opportunities in IoT development, embedded systems, and connected device projects. If you're working on something interesting in these areas, I'd be happy to hear about it.
