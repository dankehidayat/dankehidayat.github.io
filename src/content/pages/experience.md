## Internship & Work Experience

### Junior Software Developer

**PT. Labdha Teknika Nusantara** (On-Site) | Bandung, Indonesia
_Oct. 2025 - Present_

As a junior software developer at PT. Labdha Teknika Nusantara, I help design, implement, and maintain reliable software for embedded and connected systems. I work closely with hardware engineers, designers, and product teams to translate requirements into robust firmware and applications, perform integration testing, participate in code reviews, and maintain clear technical documentation to ensure long-term reliability and scalability.

Notable contributions:

- Developed _trenvm_, a trend-forecast magazine mobile app built with Flutter — implemented core app features, offline reading support, and backend API integration to deliver a smooth, responsive reader experience.
- Designed UI/UX and interactive prototypes for _trenvm_ in Figma, collaborating with product designers to iterate on user flows and visual polish.
- Assisted in building the web design for the ITB PRISM financial stress‑testing demo app, contributing responsive layouts, UI mockups, and front‑end refinements to improve usability and presentation.
- Implemented features that bridge sensors, edge devices, and cloud data pipelines, and conducted integration testing to validate end‑to‑end behavior.
- Upcoming project (starting 2026): Leading the design and development of LoRaWAN-based IoT deployments for pepper agriculture in East Luwuh. Responsibilities include designing the LoRaWAN network topology, selecting and integrating low‑power sensors for soil moisture, temperature, and microclimate monitoring, building edge‑to‑cloud data pipelines for remote telemetry, and developing dashboards and alerting to help farmers optimize irrigation and improve crop yields. I'll collaborate with agronomists and local teams to ensure the solution is robust, low-cost, and easy to operate in rural conditions.

### Data Analyst (Intern)

**PT. Global Kreatif Inovasi** (Remote) | South Jakarta, Indonesia
_Dec. 2024 - Feb. 2025_

- Organized, sorted, and analyzed datasets using Google Sheets in a collaborative workspace to support reporting and decision-making.
- Ensured data accuracy and consistency across reporting pipelines, producing clear summaries for stakeholders.
- Performed testing on Android applications related to Enterprise Resource Management (ERM), identifying and documenting software issues for engineering teams.
- Communicated findings and recommended fixes that improved data quality and app stability.

### Software Tester (Intern)

**PT. Global Kreatif Inovasi** (Remote) | South Jakarta, Indonesia  
_Aug. 2024 - Dec. 2024_

- Validated visual and interaction consistency across mobile screen resolutions, ensuring an intuitive experience for end users.
- Compared application interfaces against design specifications (e.g., Figma) and documented UI/UX discrepancies.
- Simulated real user behavior to evaluate user journeys and identify usability bottlenecks.
- Collaborated with UI/UX designers to provide actionable feedback, and produced annotated screenshots and recordings to communicate issues.
- Documented test scenarios and edge cases not always covered by functional specifications; explored Odoo resource management and accounting modules for feature reference.

### Assistant IT Officer

**Wyndham Hotel Casablanca** (On-Site) | South Jakarta, Indonesia

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Engineering at Vocational School of IPB University, with a current GPA of 3.57/4.00. Beyond my academic coursework, I take on active roles in academic leadership, serving as coordinator for "Basic Computer Networking" and "Computational Mathematics" courses. These responsibilities have deepened my understanding of networking fundamentals and computational theory while allowing me to mentor junior students and contribute to curriculum development.

### Computer and Network Engineering

**SMKN 2** | Depok, West Java, Indonesia  
_Aug. 2018 - Aug. 2021_

Completed vocational training focused on computer networking and system engineering. My studies covered the fundamentals of networking infrastructure using industry-standard tools like Cisco and MikroTik, alongside professional workplace ethics.
