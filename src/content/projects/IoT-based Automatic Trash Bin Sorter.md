Built an intelligent waste sorting system equipped with smart sensors to automatically classify waste into organic, inorganic, and metal categories. The system provides real-time volume reports for each waste type, making recycling more efficient and contributing to environmental conservation efforts. This project demonstrates the practical application of IoT technology to address real-world environmental challenges.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and developed electronic schematics and embedded firmware for sensor-based waste classification
- Collaborated on 3D modeling using Autodesk Fusion to create ergonomic and functional hardware enclosures
- Developed the Blynk application interface for real-time waste volume monitoring and system management
- Performed extensive testing and debugging on both hardware and software to optimize classification accuracy
