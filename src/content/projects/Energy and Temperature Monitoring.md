Developed a comprehensive IoT-based monitoring system that integrates Mamdani fuzzy logic to analyze real-time electricity consumption and room temperature data in office environments. The system accurately identifies energy waste patterns, enabling organizations to make informed decisions about energy optimization. This project bridges the gap between embedded systems and data intelligence—the fuzzy logic engine processes complex sensor data to generate actionable insights, helping organizations reduce energy consumption amid rising electricity demands in Indonesia.
