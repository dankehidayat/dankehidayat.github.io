Engineered a water level monitoring and control system with multi-tier alert mechanisms (Safe, Warning, and Dangerous levels) designed to protect communities from flooding. When water reaches dangerous levels, the system automatically triggers a local siren to alert nearby residents while simultaneously logging real-time status updates. The system supports both online monitoring via the Blynk mobile app and offline operation through embedded logic, ensuring reliability in all conditions.

## Key Contributions

- Designed a three-level alert system with escalating warning mechanisms
- Assisted in assembling electronic components according to schematic designs
- Developed a Teams page website using the Laravel framework for centralized system information and alerts
- Integrated real-time monitoring capabilities with Blynk for remote accessibility
